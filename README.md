# TweeClo

My mission, should I choose to accept it, is to create a Twitter Clone
using the following standards:

* Project should be completed using Rails
* Gem devise should be used for authentication
* A guest or an authenticated user can browse through all users in the app and view their feed pages.
* An authenticated user can post a tweet to their feed page.
* Bonus Points: Push code to a public GitHub repository.
* Super Bonus Points: Deploy application to a Heroku instance.

You have 48 hours. May the odds be ever in your favor.
